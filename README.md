## Welcome!
This is Shuyi Bian's BIS 015L Winter 2022 repository.

email: sbian@ucdavis.edu

## About the Repository
A place for me to write down labs, homework, and notes. Practices, mistakes, and weird problems are common here.

## About Me
A psychology major, senior student at UC Davis.

Recent hobby: playing nintendo switch games :D

Recent worries: no graduate program offers, sad

## My Goal in This Class
Become an RStudio master.

...Okay, the real one is learning how to use RStudio to analyze and visualize data because I found that researchers who don’t know how to analyze data are as painful as marathon runners who don’t wear shoes.

## LET'S GOOOOOO!
